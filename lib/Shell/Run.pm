=head1 NAME

Shell::Run - Execute shell commands using specific shell

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Procedural Interface

	use Shell::Run 'sh';
	my ($input, $output, $rc, $sc);

	# no input
	sh 'echo -n hello', $output;
	print "output is '$output'\n";
	# gives "output is 'hello'"

	# input and output, status check
	$input = 'fed to cmd';
	sh 'cat', $output, $input or warn 'sh failed';
	print "output is '$output'\n";
	# gives "output is 'fed to cmd'"
	
	# insert shell variable
	sh 'echo -n $foo', $output, undef, foo => 'var from env';
	print "output is '$output'\n";
	# gives "output is 'var from env'"

	# special bash feature
	use Shell::Run 'bash';
	bash 'cat <(echo -n $foo)', $output, undef, foo => 'var from file';
	print "output is '$output'\n";
	# gives "output is 'var from file'"

	# change export name
	use Shell::Run 'sea-shell.v3' => {as => 'seash3'};
	seash3 'echo hello', $output;

	# specify program not in PATH
	use Shell::Run sgsh => {exe => '/opt/shotgun/shell'};
	sgsh 'fire', $output;

	# not a shell
	use Shell::Run sed => {args => ['-e']};
	sed 's/fed to/eaten by/', $output, $input;
	print "output is '$output'\n";
	# gives "output is 'eaten by cmd'"

	# look behind the scenes
	use Shell::Run sh => {debug => 1, as => 'sh_d'};
	sh_d 'echo -n', $output;
	# gives:
	## using shell: /bin/sh -c
	## executing cmd:
	## echo -n
	##
	## closing output from cmd
	## cmd exited with rc=0

	# remove export
	no Shell::Run qw(seash3 sgsh);
	# from here on seash3 and sgsh are no longer known
	# use aliased name (seash3) if provided!

	# capture command status code
	($sc, $rc) = sh 'exit 2';
	# status code $sc is 2, return code $rc is false


=head2 OO Interface

	use Shell::Run;

	my $bash = Shell::Run->new(name => 'bash');

	my ($input, $output);

	# input and output, status check
	$input = 'fed to cmd';
	$bash->run('cat', $output, $input) or warn('bash failed');
	print "output is '$output'\n";
	
	# everything else analogous to the procedural interface
	
=head1 DESCIPTION

The Shell::Run module provides an alternative interface for executing
shell commands in addition to 

=over

=item *
C<qx{cmd}>

=item *
C<system('cmd')>

=item *
C<open CMD, '|-', 'cmd'>

=item *
C<open CMD, '-|', 'cmd'>

=item *
L<IPC::Run>

=back

While these are convenient for simple commands, at the same
time they lack support for some advanced shell features.

Here is an example for something rather simple within bash that cannot
be done straightforward with perl:

	export passwd=secret
	key="$(openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -nodes -in somecert.pfx \
		-passin env:passwd)"
	signdata='some data to be signed'
	signature="$(echo -n "$signdata" | \
		openssl dgst -sha256 -sign <(echo "$key") -hex"
	echo "$signature"

As there are much more openssl commands available on shell level
than via perl modules, this is not so simple to adopt.
One had to write the private key into a temporary file and feed
this to openssl within perl.
Same with input and output from/to the script: one has to be
on file while the other may be written/read to/from a pipe.

Other things to consider:

=over

=item *
There is no way to specify by which interpreter C<qx{cmd}> is executed.

=item *
The default shell might not understand constructs like C<<(cmd)>.

=item *
perl variables are not accessible from the shell.

=back

Another challenge consists in feeding the called command
with input from the perl script and capturing the output at
the same time.
While this last item is perfectly solved by L<IPC::Run>,
the latter is rather complex and even requires some special setup to
execute code by a specific shell.

The module Shell::Run tries to merge the possibilities of the
above named alternatives into one. I.e.:

=over

=item *
use a specific command interpreter e.g. C<bash>.

=item *
provide the command to execute as a single string, like in C<system()>

=item *
give access to the full syntax of the command interpreter

=item *
enable feeding of standard input and capturing standard output
of the called command 

=item *
enable access to perl variables within the called command

=item *
easy but flexible usage

=back

Using the Shell::Run module, the above given shell script example
might be implemented this way in perl:

	use Shell::Run 'bash';

	my $passwd = 'secret';
	my $key;
	bash 'openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -nodes -in demo.pfx \
		-passin env:passwd', $key, undef, passwd => $passwd;
	my $signdata = 'some data to be signed';
	my $signature;
	bash 'openssl dgst -sha256 -sign <(echo "$key") -hex',
		 $signature, $signdata, key => $key;
	print $signature;

Quite similar, isn't it?

Actually, the call to C<openssl dgst> as above was the very reason
to create this module.

Commands run by Shell::Run are by default executed via the C<-c> option
of the specified shell.
This behaviour can be modified by providing other arguments in the
C<use> statement or the constructor C<< Shell::Run->new >>.

Debugging output can be enabled in a similar way.

=head2 Procedural vs OO interface

The procedural interface acts as a wrapper for the OO interface
with a hidden object instance.
Despite syntax, there is no difference in funtionallity between

C<< $sh->run('something', ...) >>

and

C<sh 'something', ...>

The only difference is I<when> the instance of Shell::Run is created.
With C<use Shell::Run 'shell'> it happens in a C<BEGIN> block
and with C<< $shell = Shell::Run->new(name => 'shell') >> at runtime.

So use the OO interface

=over

=item *
if you like it more

=item *
if need a reference to the C<run> subroutine

=item *
if you want to catch errors from the C<new> constructor at runtime

=back

and use the procedural interface

=over

=item *
if you like it more

=item *
if you prefer a terse syntax

=back

=head1 USAGE

The procedural interface's behaviour can be configured by arguments given
to the C<use> statement.
Providing arguments to the C<use Shell::Run> statement is mandatory
for the procedural interfaces as nothing will be exported by default.

=over

=item use Shell::Run qw(I<name>...)

Searches every given I<name> in C<PATH> and exports a subroutine of the
same name for each given argument into the caller for accessing the
specified external programs.

=item use Shell::Run I<name> => I<options>, ...

Export a subroutine into the caller for accessing an external program.
Unless otherwise specified in I<options>, search for an executable
named I<name> in C<PATH> and export a subroutine named I<name>

I<options> must be a hash reference as follows:

=over

=item exe => I<executable>

Use I<executable> as the path to an external program.
Disables a C<PATH> search.

=item args => I<arguments>

Call the specified external program with these arguments.
Must be a reference to an array.

Default: C<['-c']>.

=item as => I<export>

Use I<export> as the name of the exported subroutine.

=item debug => I<debug>

Provide debugging output to C<STDERR> if I<debug> has a true value.

=back

=back

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head3 I<name> I<cmd>, I<output>, [I<input>, [I<key> => I<value>,...]]

Call external program configured as I<name>.

=over

=item I<cmd>

The code that is to be executed by this shell.

=item I<output>

A scalar that will receive STDOUT from I<cmd>.
The content of this variable will be overwritten.

=item I<input>

An optional scalar holding data that is fed to STDIN of I<cmd>

=item I<key> => I<value>, ...

A list of key-value pairs that are set in the environment of the
called shell.

=back

In scalar context, returns true or false according
to the exit status of the called command.
In list context, returns two values: the completion code
of the executed command and the exit status as the
logical negation of the completion code from a perl view.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Constructor

=head3 Shell::Run->new([I<options>])

I<options> (if provided) must be a hash as follows:

=over

=item name => I<name>

Searches I<name> in C<PATH> for an external program to be used.

This value is ignored if I<executable> is given and defaults to C<sh>.

=item exe => I<executable>

Use I<executable> as the path to an external program.
Disables a C<PATH> search.

=item args => I<arguments>

Call the specified external program with these arguments.
Must be a reference to an array.

Default: C<['-c']>.

=item debug => I<debug>

Provide debugging output to C<STDERR> if I<debug> has a true value.

=back

=head2 Methods

=head3 $sh->run(I<cmd>, I<output>, [I<input>, [I<key> => I<value>, ...]])

=over

=item I<cmd>

The code that is to be executed by this shell.

=item I<output>

A scalar that will receive STDOUT from I<cmd>.
The content of this variable will be overwritten.

=item I<input>

An optional scalar holding data that is fed to STDIN of I<cmd>

=item I<key> => I<value>, ...

A list of key-value pairs that are set in the environment of the
called shell.

=back

In scalar context, returns true or false according
to the exit status of the called command.
In list context, returns two values: the completion code
of the executed command and the exit status as the
logical negation of the completion code from a perl view.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

There seems to be some race condition when the called script
closes its input file prior to passing all provided input
data to it.
Sometimes a SIGPIPE is caught and sometimes C<syswrite>
returns an error.
It is not clear if all situations are handled correctly.

Best effort has been made to avoid blocking situations
where neither reading output from the script
nor writing input to it is possible.
However, under some circumstance such blocking might occur.
